# AVR Libraries
 Containes AVR Libraries which can handy when programming Atmel microcontrllers. The Libraries were written in AVR C and written basesd on the datasheets and 3rd party code alredy available in the internet.All of the librarys are working and tested for atmega328p microcontrller for desired outcome.
 
 The collection contain fallowing libraries
 - BMP180 (Barometric pressure and temperature sensor)
 - HMC5883L (Triple-axis magnetometer compass module)
 - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit used for short range communication in microcontrller circuits, only master mode)
 - LCD 16 * 2 (HD44780 compatible library for communicating with 16*2 LCD)
 - UART (Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter used for serial communication in microcontrller circuits)
